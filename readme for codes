Instructions:-

The files contain only the codes and also use codes of other files as an include.
So, no files contain main function. Instead it is kept in a separate single file called main.cpp
Just copy and paste the main function from the main file to run and check the code.

P.S:- Queue and stack created from array have their own main functions.
P.S:- Oh! and I'm sorry for the weird pseudocodes, i was just in a different mood XD...


Have a nice day
SHASHANK ;-)
